4. > The historian Frederick J. Turner wrote in the 1890's that the agrarian discontent (that had been developing steadily in the United States since about 1870) had been precipitated by the closing of the internal frontier---that is, the depletion of available new land(needed for further expansion of the American farming system).

16. > Under the force of this view, it was perhaps inevitable that the art of rhetoric should pass from the status of being regarded as of questionable worth (because although it might be both a source of pleasure and a means to urge people right action, it might also be a means to distort truth and a source of misguided action) to the status of being wholly condemned.

1. > The sex ratio will be favored which maximizes the number of descendants an individual will have and hence the number of gene copies transmitted.

2. > Hardy's weakness derived from his apparent inability to control the comings and goings of these divergent impulse and from his unwillingness to cultivate and sustain the energetic and risky ones.

3. > Virginia Woolf's provocative statement about her intentions in writing Mrs. Dalloway has regularly been ignored by the critics, since it highlights an aspect her literary interests very different from the traditional picture of the "poetic" novelist concerned with examining states of reverie and vision and with following the intricate pathways of  individual consciousness.

6. > Although the Gutman admits that forced separation by sale was frequent, he shows that the slaves' preference, revealed most clearly on plantations where sale was infrequent, was very much for stable monogamy.
   >
   > * monogamy
   >
   > > n. 一夫一妻制

7. > Gutman argues convincingly that the stability of Black family encouraged the transmission of --- and so was crucial in sustaining---the Black heritage of folklore, music, and religious expression from one generation to another, a heritage that slaves were continually fashioning out of their African and American experiences.

8. > This preference for exogamy, Gutman suggests, may have derived from West African rules governing marriage, which, though they differed from one tribal group to another, all involved some kind of prohibition against unions with close kin.

9. > His thesis works relatively well when applied to discrimination against Blacks in the United States, but his definition of racial prejudice as "racially-based negative prejudgments against group generally accepted as a race in any given region of ethnic competition," can be interpreted as also including hostility toward such ethnic groups as the Chinese in California and the Jews in medieval in Europe.

10. > Such variations in size, shape, chemistry, conduction speed, excitation threshold, and the like as had been demonstrated in nerve cells remained negligible in significance  for any possible correlation with the manifold dimensions of mental experience.

##### 11-15

11. > It was possible to demonstrate by other methods refined structural differences among neuron types; however, proof was lacking that the quality of the impulse or its condition was influenced by these differences, which seemed instead to influence the developmental patterning of the neural circuits.

12. > Although  qualitative variance among nerve energies was never rigidly disproved, the doctrine was generally abandoned in favor of the opposing view, namely, that nerving impulse are essentially homogeneous in quality and are transmitted as "common currency" throughout the nervous system.

13. > Other experiments revealed the slight variations in size, number, arrangement, and the interconnection of the nerve cells, but as far as a psychoneural correlation were concerned, the obvious similarities of these sensory fields to each other seemed much more remarkable than any of the minute differences.

14. > Although some experiments shows that, as an object becomes familiar, its internal representation becomes more holistic and the recognition process correspondingly more parallel, the weight of evidence seems to support the serial hypothesis, at least for objects that are not notably simple and familiar.
    >
    > * holistic
    >
    > > adj. 全部的

15. > In large part as a consequence of the feminists movement,  historian have focused a great deal of attention recent years on determining more accurately the status of women in various periods.
    >
    > > focus A on B 把A集中于B

##### 16-20

16. > If one begins by examining why ancients refer to Amazons, it becomes clear that ancient Greek descriptions of such societies were meant not so much to represent observed historical fact---real Amazonian societies---but rather to offer "moral lessons" on the supposed outcome of women's rule in their own society.

17. > Thus, for instance, it may come as a shock to mathematicians to learn that the Schrodinger equation for the hydrogen atom is not a literally correct description of this atom,  but only an approximation to a somewhat more equation taking account of spin, magnetic dipole, and relativistic effects; and that this corrected equation is itself only an imperfect approximation to an infinite set of quantum field-theoretical equations.
    >
    > * literally 
    >
    > > adv. 逐字地; 照字面地
    > > 确实地, 真正地

18. > The physicist rightly dreads precise argument, since an argument that is convincing only if it is precise loses all its force if the assumptions on which it is based are slightly changes, whereas an argument that is convincing though imprecise may well be stable under small perturbations of its underlying assumptions.
    >
    > * rightly

19. > However, as they gained cohesion, the Bluestockings came to regard themselves as a women's group and to possess as sense of female solidary lacking in salonnieres, who remained, isolated from one another by the primacy each held in her own salon.

20. > As my own studies have advanced, I have been increasingly impressed with the functional similarities between  insect and vertebrate societies and less so with the structural differences that seem, at first glance, to constitute such an immerse gulf between them.

##### 21-25

21. > Although fiction assuredly springs from political circumstances, its authors react to those circumstances, in ways other than ideological, and talking about novels and stories primarily as instruments of ideology circumvents much of fictional enterprise.
    >
    > * circumvent
    >
    > > vt. 设法克服或避免(某事物);回避

22. > Is this a defect, or are the authors working out of,  or trying forge, a different kind of aesthetic?
    >
    > * defect
    >
    > > n. 缺点，缺陷；不足之处
    > > vi. 叛变；变节

23. > In addition, the style of some Black novels, like Jean Toomer's Cane, verges on expressionism or surrealism; does this technique provide a counterpoint to prevalent theme that portrays the fate against which Black heroes are pitted, a theme usually conveyed by more naturalistic modes of expression?
    >

    >
    > * verge on

24. > Black Fiction surveys a wide variety of novels, bringing to our attention in the process some fascinating and little-known works like James Weldon Johnson's Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man.

25. > Although these molecules allow radiation at visible wave-lengths, where most of the energy of sunlight is concentrated, to pass through, they absorb some if the longer-wavelength, infrared emissions radiated from the Earth's surface, radiation that would otherwise be transmitted back into space.
    >
    > * infrared
    >
    > > adj. 〈物〉红外线的

##### 26-30

26. > The role those anthropologists ascribe to evolution is not of dictating the details of human behavior but one of imposing constraints---ways of feeling, thinking, and acting that "come naturally" in archetypal situation in any culture.
    >
    > * ascribe

27. > Which of the following most probably provides an appropriate analogy from human morphology for the "details" versus "constraints" distinction made in the passage in relation to human to human behavior?

28. > A low number of algal cells in the presence of a high number of grazers suggested, but did not prove, that the grazers  had removed most of the algae.

    > * grazer
    >
    > > n. 吃草的动物，食草动物
    >
    > * algal
    >
    > > adj. 海藻的

29. > Perhaps the fact that most of these first studies considered only algae of a size that could be collected in a net(net phytoplankton), a practice that over-looked the smaller phytoplankton(nannoplankton) that we now know grazers are most likely to feed on, led to a de-emphasis of the role of grazers in subsequent research.
    >
    > * a practice
    >
    > > 这样一个做法

30. > Studies by Hargrave and Geen estimated natural community grazing rates by measuring feeding rates of individual zooplankton species in laboratory and then computing community  grazing rates for field conditions using the known population density of grazers.

##### 31-35

31. > In the periods of peak zooplankton abundance, that is, in the late spring and in the summer, Haney recorded maximum daily community grazing rates, for nutrient-poor lakes and bog lakes, respectively, of 6.6 percent and 114 percent of daily phytoplankton production.

32. > The hydrologic cycle, a major topic in this science, is the complete cycle of phenomena through which water passes, beginning as atmospheric water vapor, passing into liquid and solid form as precipitation, thence passing along and entering into the ground surface, and finally again returning to the form of  atmospheric water vapor by means of evaporation and transpiration.

34. > The historian Frederick J. Turner wrote in the 1890's that the agrarian discontent that had been developing steadily in the United States since about 1870 had been precipitated by the closing of the internal frontier- that is, the depletion of available new land needed for further expansion of the American farming system.
    
35. > In the early 1950's, historians who studied preindustrial Europe ( which we may define here as Europe in the period from roughly 1300 to 1800) began, for the first time in large numbers, to investigate more of the preindustrial European population than the 2 or 3 percent who comprised the political and social elite: the kings, generals, judges, nobles, bishops, and local magnates who had hitherto usually filled history books.

##### 36-40

36. > Historians such as Le Roy Ladurie have used the documents to extract case histories, which have illuminated the attitudes of different social groups ( these attitudes include, but are not confined to,attitudes toward crime and the law) and have revealed how the authorities administered justice.

37. > It can be inferred from the passage that a historian who wished to compare crime rates per thousand in a European city in one decade of the fifteenth century with crime rates in another decade of that century would probably be most aided by better information about which of the following?
    
38. > My point is that its central consciousness -- its profound understanding of class and gender as shaping influences on people's lives -- owes much to that earlier literary heritage, a heritage that, in general, has not been sufficiently valued by most contemporary literary critics.

##### 41-45

41. > Islamic law is a phenomenon so different from all other forms of law--notwithstanding, of course, a considerable and inevitable number of coincidences with one or the other of them as far as subject matter and positive enactment are concerned--that its study is indispensable in order to appreciate adequately the full range of possible legal phenomena.

42. > Both Jewish law and canon law are more uniform than Islamic law. Though historically there is a discernible break between Jewish law of the sovereign state of ancient Israel and of the Diaspora ( the dispersion of Jewish people after the conquest of Israel), the spirit of the legal matter in later parts of the Old Testament is very close to that of the Talmud, one of the primary codifications of Jewish law in the Diaspora.

43. > Islam, on the other hand, represented a radical breakaway from the Arab paganism that preceded it; Islamic law is the result of an examination, from a religious angle, of legal subject matter that was far from uniform, comprising as it did the various components of the laws of pre-Islamic Arabia and numerous legal elements taken over from non-Arab peoples of the conquered territories.

44. > One such novel idea is that of inserting into the chromosomes of plants discrete genes that are not a part of the plants' natural constitution: specifically, the idea of inserting into nonleguminous plants the genes, if they can be identified and isolated, that fit the leguminous plants to be hosts for nitrogen-fixing bacteria.

49. > A critique of the Handlins' interpretation of why legal slavery did not appear until the 1660's suggests that assumptions about the relation between slavery and racial prejudice should be reexamined, and that explanations for the different treatment of Black slaves in North and South America should be expanded.

50. > The best evidence for the layered mantle thesis is the well-established fact that volcanic rocks found on oceanic islands, islands believed to result from mantle plumes arising from the lower mantle, are composed of material fundamentally different from that of the midocean ridge system, whose source, most geologists contend, is the upper mantle.

51. > Some geologists, however, on the basis of observations concerning mantle xenoliths, argue that the mantle is not layered, but that heterogeneity is created by fluids rich in “incompatible elements”(elements tending toward liquid rather than solid state) percolating upward and transforming portions of the upper mantle irregularly, according to the vagaries of the fluids' pathways.

52. > Fallois proposed that Proust had tried to begin a novel in 1908, abandoned it for what was to be a long demonstration of Saint-Beuve's blindness to the real nature of great writing, found the essay giving rise to personal memories and fictional developments, and allowed these to take over in a steadily developing novel.

53. > The very richness and complexity of the meaningful relationships that kept presenting and rearranging themselves on all levels, from abstract intelligence to profound dreamy feelings, made it difficult for Proust to set them out coherently.

56. > It is possible to make specific complementary DNA's (cDNA's) that can serve as molecular probes to seek out the messenger RNA's ( mRNA's) of the peptide hormones. If brain cells are making the hormones, the cells will contain these mRNA's. If the products the brain cells make resemble the hormones but are not identical to them, then the cDNA's should still bind to these mRNA's, but should not bind as tightly as they would to mRNA's for the true hormones.

61. > Many critics of Emily Bronte's novel Wuthering Heights see its second part as a counterpoint that comments on, if it does not reverse, the first part, where a "romantic" reading receives more confirmation.

62. > Granted that the presence of these elements need not argue an authorial awareness of novelistic construction comparable to that of Henry James, their presence does encourage attempts to unify the novel's heterogeneous parts.

66. > A long-held view of the history of the English colonies that became the United States has been that England's policy toward these colonies before 1763 was dictated by commercial interests and that a change to a more imperial policy, dominated by expansionist militarist objectives, generated the tensions that ultimately led to the American Revolution.

67. > It is not known how rare this resemblance is, or whether it is most often seen in inclusions of silicates such as garnet, whose crystallography is generally somewhat similar to that of diamond; but when present, the resemblance is regarded as; compelling evidence that the diamonds and inclusions are truly cogenetic.

68. > Even the "radical" critiques of this mainstream research model, such as the critique developed in Divided Society, attach the issue of ethnic assimilation too mechanically to factors of economic and social mobility and are thus unable to illuminate the cultural subordination of Puerto Ricans as a colonial minority.

69. > They are called virtual particles in order to distinguish them from real  particles，whose lifetimes are not constrained in the same way, and which can be detected.

70. > Open acknowledgement of the existence of women's oppression was too radical for the United States in the fifties, and Beauvoir's conclusion, that change in women's economic condition, though insufficient by itself, "remains the basic factor”in improving women's situation, was particularly unacceptable.

71. > Other theorists propose that the Moon was ripped out of the Earth's rocky mantle by the Earth's collision with another large celestial body after much of the Earth's iron fell to its core.
    
72. > However, recent scholarship has strongly suggested that: those aspects of early New England culture that seem to have been most distinctly Puritan, such as the strong religious orientation and the communal impulse, were not even typical of New England; as a whole, but were largely confined to the two colonies of Massachusetts and Connecticut.

73. > Thus, what in contrast to the Puritan colonies appears to Davis to be peculiarly Southern-acquisitiveness a strong interest in politics and the law, and a tendency to cultivate metropolitan cultural models--was not only more typically English than the cultural patterns exhibited by Puritan Massachusetts and Connecticut, but also almost certainly characteristic of most other early modern British colonies from Barbados north to Rhode Island and New Hampshire.

74. > Portrayals of the folk of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, whom he remembers from early childhood, of the jazz musicians and tenement roofs of his Harlem days, of Pittsburgh steelworkers, and his reconstruction of classical Greek myths in the guise of the ancient Black kingdom of Benin, attest to this.

75. > A very specialized feeding adaptation in zooplankton is that of the tadpolelike appendicularian who lives in a walnut-sized ( or smaller ) balloon of mucus equipped with filters that capture and concentrate phytoplankton.

77. > Apparently most massive stars manage to lose sufficient material that their masses drop below the critical value of 1.4 M before they exhaust their nuclear fuel.

78. > This is so even though the armed forces operate in an ethos of institutional change oriented toward occupational equality and under the federal sanction of equal pay for equal work.

79. > An impact capable of ejecting a fragment of the Martian surface into an Earth-intersecting orbit is even less probable than such an event on the Moon, in view of the Moon's smaller size and closer proximity to Earth.

80. > Not only are liver transplants never rejected, but they even induce a state of donor-specific unresponsiveness in which subsequent transplants of other organs, such as skin, from that donor are accepted permanently.
